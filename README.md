Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:

a. Define Software Engineering: What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to developing software. It applies both computer science and engineering principles and practices to the creation, the use or operation and maintenance of software systems. It differs from traditional programming because traditional programming normally follows a linear process where designs are finalized before the construction begins. whereas with software engineering software is continously refined and improved as per user feedback.

b. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Phase 1: Planning
The first stage of software development is Planning, Planning involves defining the software’s purpose and scope, much like pinpointing our destination and plotting the best route. We uncover the tasks at hand during this phase and strategize for efficient execution. In addition, the Planning phase fosters effective communication and collaboration within the team. By defining clear roles, responsibilities, and expectations, it lays a solid foundation for an efficient software development process. 

Phase 2: Requirements Analysis
Phase 2 of the Software Development Life Cycle, Requirements Analysis, seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users. In this phase, the team is looking to answer, “What are the expectations of our users from our software?” This is called requirements gathering.The project team collects information from stakeholders, including analysts, users, and clients. They conduct interviews, surveys, and focus groups to understand the user’s expectations and needs. The process involves not only asking the right questions but also accurately interpreting the responses.
After collecting the data, the team analyzes it, distinguishing the essential features from the desirable ones. This analysis helps the team understand the software’s functionality, performance, security, and interface needs.

Phase 3: Design
The Design phase is all about building the framework. The development team is responsible for software engineering and outlines the software’s functionality and aesthetic. This ultimately results in the software product. The emphasis lies on outlining the software’s structure, navigation, user interfaces, and database design. This phase ensures that the software is user-friendly and performs its tasks efficiently.

Phase 4: Coding
The Coding phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code.

Phase 5: Testing
The Testing phase of the SDLC as a stringent quality inspection on a production line. It is when vulnerabilities are uncovered. Software testing involves a thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that might have slipped through during coding. The aim is to ensure flawless software operation before it reaches the end-users. And even identify opportunities for enhancement.

Phase 6: Deployment
The Deployment phase involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users. 
Deployment is about ensuring users can operate it with ease. This responsibility might involve creating user manuals, conducting training sessions, or offering on-site support.  

Phase 7: Maintenance
In the Software Development Life Cycle, the maintenance phase is characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software’s best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.

C. Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Waterfall Model 

This is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed prior to moving on to the next step. The phases include requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Agile Model

The agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration between cross-functional teams. When implementing an agile model, requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration and adaptation to change.

d. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile model follows the incremental approach, where each incremental part is developed through iteration after every timebox.Waterfall model follows a sequential design process.

Agile model is flexible as there is a possibility of changing the requirements even after starting the development process.	On the other hand, the waterfall model is rigid as it does not allow to modify the requirements once the development process starts.


It has a small team size. As smaller is the team, the fewer people work on it so that they can move faster.	In the waterfall model, the team may consist more members.

Agile model is not a suitable model for small projects. The expenses of developing the small projects using agile is more than compared to other models.	Waterfall model works well in smaller size projects where requirements are easily understandable. But waterfall model is not suitable for developing the large projects.

The test plan is reviewed after each sprint.	Test plan is reviewed after complete development.

e. Requirements Engineering:What is requirements engineering? 

What is Requirements Engineering?

A systematic and strict approach to the definition, creation, and verification of requirements for a software system is known as requirements engineering. To guarantee the effective creation of a software product, the requirements engineering process entails several tasks that help in understanding, recording, and managing the demands of stakeholders.

f. Software Design Principles:Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?


What is Modularity?

Modularity in software engineering means breaking complex software systems down into smaller manageable modules or components that are tightly coupled together. They can also be constructed as independent subsystems designed and executed individually apart from other system elements since each module carries out a specific mission. The aim, therefore, is to simplify by modularizing the program into units or reusable building blocks that can be easily exchanged for one another.


Modularity simplifies the maintenance process. Updates and changes do not affect specific modules; thus, there is a minimal risk of undesirable side effects. This gives a quick change or growth of a software system. Additional modules could be added to enable more features or expand on existing features and functions. Scalability is important for software systems as they must be flexible enough to adapt to changing requirements. 


g. Testing in Software Engineering:Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing: In this type of testing, errors are identified individually in each component or unit by testing software components or units individually to ensure that they are suitable for use by developers. It is the smallest testable part of the software. 

Integration Testing: In this testing, two or more unit tested modules are integrated to test ie. the components that interact with the technology and then it is checked whether those integrated modules work as expected or not and interface errors are also detected.

System testing: In system testing, complete and integrated software is tested, ie. all system elements forming the system are tested as a whole so that they fulfill the system requirements.  

Acceptance Testing: This is a kind of testing conducted to ensure that the requirements of the users are fulfilled before its delivery and that the software works correctly in the user’s working environment.

h. Version Control Systems: What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control, also known as source control, is the tracking and management of changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software development teams manage source code changes over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems are helping software development teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams because they help reduce development time and increase successful deployments. 

They are important because Using version control software is a best practice for high performing software and DevOps teams. Version control also helps developers move faster and allows software teams to preserve efficiency and agility as the team scales to include more developers. Version control system helps manage the software team's source code by tracking all code changes. It also protects the source code against all unintentional human errors and consequences.

i. Role of a software project manager. 

Software managers are responsible for overseeing and coordinating the people, resources, and processes needed to deliver new software or update existing products. In smaller firms, software managers may take a hands-on role in software development. However, their main task is project management, coordinating the work of other software specialists. 
Challenges of software project managers can be:

Misalignment between goals and business objectives 
Communication 
Lack of accountability 
Resource allocation 
Scope creep
Project management software
Poor planning and unrealistic deadlines 

j. Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities.

Software maintenance is an integral part of the software life cycle that involves modifying and updating software after it has been deployed. The goal of maintenance is to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, and adapt the software to a changing environment throughout its lifetime. 

k. Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering: What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?


Addictive design;
corporate ownership of personal data;
algorithmic bias;
weak cyber security and personally identifiable information (PII) protection; and
overemphasis on features.

They can undergo training on ethical principles, ethical decision-making frameworks, and case studies to enhance their ethical awareness.
